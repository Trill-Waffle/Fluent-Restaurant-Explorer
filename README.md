Fluent Restaurant Explorer 

This code provides a fluent interface for filtering and selecting restaurants from a dataset. You can chain methods like `fromState`, `ratingLeq`, `ratingGeq`, `reviewGeq`, `category`, and `hasAmbience` to narrow down the list of restaurants.  

Additionally, there are two special methods for identifying the “best” restaurants:  
- `bestPlace()`* picks the highest-rated restaurant, breaking ties by review count, then by whichever appears first in the dataset.  
- `mostReviews()` picks the restaurant with the most reviews, breaking ties by highest rating, then by whichever appears first.  

A set of tests confirms that each filter and selection criterion works correctly. This makes it straightforward to explore and query the restaurant data in a concise, chainable manner.
